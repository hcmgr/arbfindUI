TODO
    - change bookmaker key to bookmaker title (OR, do thing below)
    - hyperlink bookies
        - for Arb object, could add a Bookmaker object, which has:
            - bookmakerkey, bookmakertitle, bookmakerurl (all of it is useful)
    - put min/max profit fields below current ones
    - add a 'calculate' button next to total stake (i.e. on press, stakes are populated)
    - general calculation logic for dialog
    - login flow?
        - immediately go to login screen?
        - what do I actually need persistence for?
    - group by sport
        - collapsable by sport
        - i.e. would be helpful to collapse sport with heaps of arbs that are not worth betting on
          (e.g. because the game is currently on, and odds fluctuating wildly)
